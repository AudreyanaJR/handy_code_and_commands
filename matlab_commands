handy code or command line

%%%matlab specific%%%%

%%have a bunch of empty cells in a cell list and you want to remove the empty stuff do this:

newVar = Var(~cellfun('isempty',Var);

%%Var is the cell variable you want to convert

%%Try and Catch - this is helpful to let you go through a loop, and instead of failing when there are errors
%%instead it catches the error then continues to the next iteration of the loop, super helpful for debugging

try
whatever_function(var)
catch
  option_here_to_save_something_when_function_fails
end

%%%system - allows you to make a command that you woudl typicaly have to do in a bash, while in matlab

system('insert_bash_based_command')
%%specific example
system(['mri_convert ',fullfile(PATHanat,T1_image.name),' ',PATHanat,'/',out_subname,'_',session,'_T1w.nii.gz'])
